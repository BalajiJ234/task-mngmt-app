# Project Summary: To Do Task List Application

## Project Overview:

- Frontend: ReactJS (with Microfrontend Architecture)
- Backend: Node.js (with Microservices Architecture)
- Database: SQL Server
- Workflow Engine: Camunda BPM for managing business processes
- Architecture: Microservices & Microfrontends

## Steps Completed So Far

### 1. Project Setup

Microservices Setup:
_ Task Service: Manages tasks (CRUD operations)
_ User Service: Manages user registration, login, and profiles \* Notification Service: Manages task-related notifications

Microfrontend Setup:
_ Task Management Microfrontend: Handles task creation and management
_ Task Overview Microfrontend: Displays a dashboard of tasks \* User Profile Microfrontend: Manages user settings and preferences

### 2. Database Configuration

- Sequelize ORM: Sequelize was configured for each service to interact with SQL Server.
- Migrations:
  - Created and ran migrations for:
    - Tasks: Created Tasks table.
    - Users: Created Users table.
    - Notifications: Created Notifications table with a foreign key constraint linking to the Tasks table.
- Seeders:
  - Created seeders to populate initial data for:
    - Tasks: Added initial tasks.
    - Users: Added initial users with hashed passwords.
    - Notifications: Added initial notifications linked to tasks.

## Next Steps (with Camunda Integration Before API Development)

### 3. Camunda BPM Integration

**Checklist**

- [ ] Install and configure Camunda BPM on your local environment.
- [ ] Use Camunda Modeler to create BPMN diagrams representing your business workflows, such as task creation, task assignment, and notifications.
- [ ] Deploy these BPMN process definitions to the Camunda engine using the REST API or Camunda Cockpit.

### 4. API Development

**Checklist**

- [ ] With Camunda BPM integrated and your workflows defined, develop APIs that interact directly with these workflows:
  - [ ] Task Service:
    - [ ] Develop endpoints that trigger Camunda processes when tasks are created or updated.
    - [ ] Ensure tasks are marked complete within the workflow and the database.
  - [ ] User Service:
    - [ ] Develop endpoints for user registration and login, integrated with the Camunda workflow for processes like email verification.
    - [ ] Create endpoints to assign tasks to users as part of the workflow.
  - [ ] Notification Service:
    - [ ] Develop endpoints that listen for workflow events (e.g., task deadlines) and trigger notifications accordingly.
    - [ ] Ensure that notifications are sent based on events in the Camunda workflow.

### 5. Testing and Monitoring

**Checklist**

- [ ] Begin writing unit tests for the new API endpoints, ensuring they interact with Camunda as expected.
- [ ] Test the integration between microservices, Camunda, and the database.
- [ ] Use tools like Cypress or Postman to perform end-to-end testing of the entire workflow.

### 6. CI/CD Pipeline Setup

**Checklist**

- [ ] Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate the build and testing processes.
- [ ] Deploy the application to a staging or production environment.

### 7. Advanced Monitoring & Logging

**Checklist**

- [ ] Implement centralized logging for all services, including workflow-related logs from Camunda.
- [ ] Set up monitoring for both the Node.js microservices and the Camunda BPM engine.

### 8. Final Deployment and Documentation

**Checklist**

- [ ] Containerize all services using Docker and deploy to a cloud platform like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.
- [ ] Ensure that all workflows, APIs, and integration points are well-documented.
